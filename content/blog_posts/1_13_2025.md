# 1/13/2025 - Happy New Year! :)

Ok so the first problem with this cite is being handled, that being that I don't have any money so I need to make all the html files static so they can be hosted on github pages ... with that being said I also have a server that I use to host a website but because this one is simpler than that one I am going to just work on making this one static. Which I think I can do via a CI pipeline to automate all of the process.

Ok, progress has been made :)

Here are the findings:
General CI yml file configuration:
Name:

On: This refers to what action on github should trigger this workflow
    - You can also add other parms to specify branches and what not

jobs:
    the actual thing that is being run

    build:
        which is needed to configure what os this is being run on

        steps:
        - name: it is good practice to name each step
        uses: gitusr/repo@version
            these are used to use already defined actions
        run:
            command line steps to run
        with:
            gives the workflow input parms

These are all the needed ones for this workflow to generate the static html files at least.
